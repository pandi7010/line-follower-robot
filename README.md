**Components Required:**
Arduino Uno
2 IR sensors
L298N Motor Driver
2 DC motors
Chassis with wheels
Power supply (Battery)
**Circuit Connections:**
IR Sensor 1 → Digital pin 2
IR Sensor 2 → Digital pin 3
**L298N Motor Driver:**
Motor A → Pins 9, 10 (PWM for speed control)
Motor B → Pins 5, 6
Power pins connected to external battery
**How it works:**
IR Sensors detect the black line, which is reflected less compared to white surfaces.
Motor Driver (L298N) controls the speed and direction of DC motors based on sensor readings.
